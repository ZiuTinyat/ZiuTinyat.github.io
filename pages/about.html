    Self introduction
</h1>
<div class="page-content">
	<p>
		I'm an professional game developer, especially in gameplay programming and game design. 
		I'm also enthusiastic in software development, computer graphics and music composition. 
	</p>

<h1 class="page-subtitle">
    My experiences
</h1>
<div class="page-content">
	<p>
		I'm a master student in <a href='https://www.etc.cmu.edu/'>Entertainment Technology Center</a>, at Carnegie Mellon University. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Before ETC, I was a college student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University studying Internet and Multimedia Technology. 
		This is where I started programming and fell in love with game development. 
		I learned C++, C#, Java, JS through various game projects, and gradually understood OOP and some design patterns through tons of practices. 
		Besides, I had courses about linear algebra, signal processing, computer vision, database and so on. 
		In my senior year, I went to GGJ Hong Kong 2017 at the first time and won the Best Game Integration Award with the game "Ripple Blossom", which encouraged me a lot.

<h1 class="page-subtitle">
    My hobbies
</h1>
<div class="page-content">
	<p>
		I started playing the piano from the age of 5, and all the way up to now. 
		I think the piano is the most well-interfaced instrument that can allow me to express my music efficiently, that's why I love playing the piano so much. 
		Though I don't have very professional playing skills, I am able to play whatever I listened to and edit music pieces into different styles improvisationally. 
		I love to listen to classical music, like Franz Liszt and Claude Debussy, which appears more elegant and polished to me. 
		Also sometimes I tried to write some pieces for my projects or personal interests, they recieved massive positive feedbacks from peers and instructors. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Definitely I love to play games. My favorate genres are puzzles, strategies and competitives, for example, Klotski, Tower Defense and Go Games. 
		I love games that can challenge me, train me and prove me. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I love math and I enjoy dealing with math problems. 
		I love Euclidian geometry puzzles especially, which could take me a whole day solving a geomertry puzzle, expanding the conclusion and discovering new interesting facts. 
		That is why I could be the mechanics and level designer in the game "Ripple Blossom". The principles behind the beautiful art are geometry, including hyperbolic curves and concyclic points. 
		On one hand, math attracts me because it is challenging enough. But what the most significant charm of math to me, is its pureness. 
		It stands permanently no matter how world changes, and it is the foundation of everything.
