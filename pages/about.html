    Self introduction
</h1>
<div class="page-content">
	<p>
		I'm an enthusiastic game developer, especially in programming and game design. 
		I'm also interested in software development, computer graphics and music composition. 
	</p>

<h1 class="page-subtitle">
    My experiences
</h1>
<div class="page-content">
	<p>
		I'm a junior year master student in ETC, CMU. 
		I'm currently working on a semester-long project "<a href='../projects/alice.html'> Alice's Adventure </a>" and taking "Computer Graphics" course at the same time. 
		I had a quite fulfilling fall semester here with the course "Building Virtual Worlds", in which I went through 6 rounds of fast game prototyping in team of 4-5. 
		I gained a lot of experiences in Unity and C#, as well as brain storming and game design. But the most valuable lessons were about how to cooperate and communicate. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Before ETC, I was a college student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University studying Internet and Multimedia Technology. 
		This is where I started programming and fell in love with game development. 
		I learnt C++, C#, Java, JS through various game projects, and gradually understood OOP and some design patterns through tons of practices. 
		Besides, I had courses about linear algebra, signal processing, computer vision, database and so on. 
		In my senior year, I went to GGJ Hong Kong 2017 at the first time and won the Best Game Integration Award with the game "Ripple Blossom", which encouraged me a lot.

    My hobbies
</h1>
<div class="page-content">
	<p>
		I started playing the piano from the age of 5, and all the way up to now. 
		I think the piano is the most well-interfaced instrument that can allow me to express my music efficiently, that's why I love playing the piano so much. 
		Though I don't have very professional playing skills, I am able to play whatever I listened to and edit music pieces into different styles improvisationally. 
		I love to listen to classical music, like Franz Liszt and Claude Debussy, which appears more elegant and polished to me. 
		Also sometimes I tried to write some pieces for my projects or personal interests, they recieved massive positive feedbacks from peers and instructors. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Definitely I love to play games. My favorate genres are puzzles, strategies and competitives, for example, Klotski, Tower Defense and Go Games. 
		I love games that can challenge me, train me and prove me. 
	</p>
	<p>
		My favorate hobby among all is math. It may sounds strange but I truly enjoy dealing with math problems. 
		I love Euclidian geometry extremely much. I can take whole days immersed into proving theories, expanding existing theories and discovering interesting facts. 
		The mechanics and levels in the game "Ripple Blossom" are designed exactly using geometry methods such as hyperbolic curves and concyclic points. 
		The reason why I love math are that not only it can challenge me to a large degree, but also I like its feeling of "pure". 
		Everything can be affected by something or someone on the earth but math would not.
